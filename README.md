### info

 
An ion thruster is a type of electric propulsion system that uses ions to create thrust. Ion thrusters work by accelerat- ing ions using an electric field and then expelling them at high speeds through a nozzle to create thrust.what are the parameters 
Ion thrusters typically use noble gases like xenon or argon as their propellant, although some use mercury or cesium. 

Ion thrusters are highly efficient, but they require a lot of power to operate. For this reason, they are typically used for spacecraft that need to maintain high speeds over long periods of time, such as satellites.what is the formulae 

The efficiency of an ion thruster is given by the following equation:

Efficiency = (1 - P_e / P_i) * 100%

where P_e is the power required to operate the thruster and P_i is the power required to ionize the propellant.

Ion thrusters are typically more than 60% efficient.
